A gripper is a device used to grasp and hold objects securely. Grippers come in various forms, ranging from simple mechanical claws to sophisticated robotic hands equipped with sensors and actuators. The design of a gripper depends on its intended application and the characteristics of the objects it needs to handle.

Basic grippers typically consist of rigid or flexible fingers that can close around an object to hold it firmly. They may use mechanisms such as springs, pneumatic cylinders, or electric motors to control the opening and closing motion. Grippers can be mounted on robotic arms, industrial machinery, or automated assembly lines to perform tasks such as picking up parts, sorting items, or manipulating objects in manufacturing, logistics, and other industries.

         <strong>Omni Wheels</strong> :
An omni wheel is a specialized wheel design used in robotics and vehicles to achieve omnidirectional movement. Unlike traditional wheels that only allow movement along one axis (forward and backward or side to side), omni wheels enable movement in any direction without requiring steering mechanisms or additional propulsion systems.

The design of an omni wheel typically consists of a central hub with multiple rollers or rollers attached at an angle around its circumference. These rollers have a unique profile that allows the wheel to move freely in any direction while rotating around its axis. By combining multiple omni wheels mounted at different orientations, a vehicle or robot can achieve omnidirectional motion.

            <strong>Mechanum Wheels</strong>:
            Mecanum wheels offer a more sophisticated design that provides superior performance in various terrains. Let's explore their intricacies:
             Unlike omni wheels, Mecanum wheels have rollers se t at an angle of 45 degrees on the main wheel body. These angled rollers are the secret sauce of Mecanum wheels.
             Applications of mechanum wheels are Robotics competitions where maneuverability and power are crucial.Search and rescue robots that need to navigate uneven terrain.Industrial robots operating in dynamic environments with varying floor conditions.

Robot chassis are the structural framework or body of a robot, analogous to the skeleton of a living organism. They provide support and house various components such as sensors, actuators, power systems, and control electronics. Chassis come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials, depending on the specific application and requirements of the robot.Some common types of robot chassis include:
Wheeled Chassis,Tracked Chassis,Legged Chassis,Aerial Chassis,Submersible Chassis,Custom Chassis.

<p >
  Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits that function as the brain of embedded systems. They contain a CPU (Central Processing Unit), memory (RAM, ROM, EEPROM), and various peripherals like timers, serial communication interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C), analog-to-digital converters (ADC), and digital I/O pins, all on a single chip.
  There are various types of Microcontrollers avalaible in market.Most commonly we used in our bots are ESP32,Ardiuno and Rpi.

 <strong>Mdds10</strong> :
 MDDS10 likely refers to the "MDDS10" motor driver board, which is commonly used in robotics and mechatronics projects. The MDDS10 is a motor driver board designed to control DC brushed motors and stepper motors. It typically features multiple motor channels, allowing users to control the speed and direction of motors independently. These motor driver boards often provide additional features such as current sensing, overcurrent protection, and various input interfaces (such as PWM control and serial communication) for easy integration into different projects. The MDDS10 and similar motor driver boards are popular choices for hobbyists, students, and professionals alike, providing a convenient and reliable way to drive motors in various applications.

  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mdds30</strong>:
    The "MDDS30" is likely another motor driver board, possibly a more advanced version or a variation of the MDDS10. Like its predecessor, it is designed to control DC brushed motors and stepper motors, offering multiple motor channels for independent control of motor speed and direction. The "30" in its name might suggest that it supports higher power motors or has additional features compared to the MDDS10. These features could include higher current ratings, more advanced control algorithms, additional protection mechanisms, or enhanced communication interfaces for seamless integration into robotics, automation, and mechatronics projects. Overall, the MDDS30 likely serves as a versatile solution for driving motors in various applications, providing flexibility, reliability, and performance for both hobbyist and professional projects.
